[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/saisandeepvaddi/Ten%20Hands/_apis/build/status/All%20OS?branchName=releases)](https://dev.azure.com/saisandeepvaddi/Ten%20Hands/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=releases)

# What is this?

Do you keep opening terminals to run your scripts/commands/tasks etc,. If you have to do that everyday for same project (Example running scripts from `package.json` for multiple projects), `Ten Hands` makes it easier to organize all your tasks in one place.
You can organize tasks into projects and run them whenever you want with a click of a button.

# Downloads

Downloads are available in `releases` section if you just want to download and run.

# Installing browser version

This project can be run in browser instead of desktop version. Before installing browser version, check what additional features the desktop version has currently.

1. Drag & Drop **package.json** to add project.
2. Link to open project directory in file explorer.

To run in browser.

1. Install `ten-hands-cli` tool from npm.

```
  npm install --global ten-hands-cli

  (or)

  yarn global add ten-hands-cli
```

2. Start app

```
  ten-hands start
```

3. Your teminal will show you the localhost address with port where Ten Hands is running. Copy and open it in browser.

# Configuration

A `config.json` is supported which is placed at `~/.ten-hands/` path.

> Check [Configration](https://github.com/saisandeepvaddi/ten-hands/wiki/Configuration) at Wiki for configuration options.

You have to restart the app when you change configuration.

## FAQ

1. Can I create a project without `package.json`?

> Yes, a project in `ten-hands` is just a group of tasks for organization purpose. It is **not** specific for running nodejs based projects. So, if you are not using a nodejs based project, simply create a project with any name. Then add your tasks with any name and command.

2. Does adding a task in a project updates the project's `package.json`?

> No, when you create a project from `package.json`, it extracts it's name, scripts, directory path (in desktop version) and saves in it's own database file (~/.ten-hands/db.json). `package.json` is only useful to quickly create a project from file. You can add more tasks related or unrelated to this nodejs project once a project is created.

3. I just need to run global commands as tasks. Do I have to give a path? What path do I use?

> Yes, in that case, just give some valid path where the command has permissions to execute. Note that if you do not enter a path while creating task, it tries to execute in the project's path.

4. My app doesn't start.

> Try changing the port in config file and restart the app.

5. My task automatically stops saying `process closed with code` right after clicking the start button.

> Check if task is running at correct path. By default, task is executed in the project directory path if no path entered at task creation time. Relative paths to project path _do not_ work. When you create a task, you either have to enter the whole absolute path where the task needs to execute or leave empty to run it at project's path.

6. I don't want a desktop app. Is there a browser version available?

> Yes, install `ten-hands-cli` from npm. Check [ten-hands-cli](https://npm.im/ten-hands-cli) for details.

7. App installation says Ten Hands is from Unknown Publisher(Windows) or unidentified developer(macOS). Is it safe to install?

> Of course, every single line of code is open source for you to verify. I just couldn't buy expensive code signing certificates. Google "how to install app from unidentified developer" for steps to allow app in macOS.
